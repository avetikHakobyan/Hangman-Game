# Hangman Game

This folder contains all the files required to run the classic hangman game written in Java during the Programming III course.

The goal of the activity is to create an application to play the Hangman game. A collection of words (or word phrases) is read from a text file. The word that the player is attempting to guess should be chosen by the Hangman software at random. For each letter that can be guessed in the word, the game shows a placeholder (such as '_'). Then the player makes aÂ single letter at a time guesses.

Learning objectives include:

- Draw a class diagram.
- Design JUnit test cases for a linked list.
- Use a singly linked list.  
- Use a doubly linked list.
- Write a serialized object.
- Read a serialized object.
